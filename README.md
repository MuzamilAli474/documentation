E-Commerce Website Using REST and Stateless API Architecture
1. Introduction
In e-commerce, having a scalable and efficient architecture is key to handling multiple users and requests. This documentation outlines the use of REST (Representational State Transfer) and stateless APIs for an e-commerce platform, ensuring flexibility, scalability, and high performance.

2. REST API Architecture
REST APIs follow a client-server model where the frontend (client) communicates with the backend (server) via HTTP requests. Each resource (like products, users, and orders) is represented by a unique URL. REST APIs are designed to be stateless, meaning the server doesn’t retain information between requests. This approach makes the system more scalable.

REST API Endpoints for E-commerce:
Products:
GET /api/products – Fetch all products
GET /api/products/{id} – Fetch a specific product
POST /api/products – Add a new product
PUT /api/products/{id} – Update a product
DELETE /api/products/{id} – Delete a product

Users:
POST /api/users/login – User login

Orders:
POST /api/orders – Place an order

Payments:
POST /api/payments – Process a payment

3. Stateless API Architecture
In a stateless API, every request is independent, meaning the server does not store any client data between requests. This reduces server load and allows for easier scaling. E-commerce websites benefit from stateless APIs by using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication, ensuring that user sessions are maintained without storing any state on the server.

Example of Stateless Authentication:
Login:
The client sends a POST request to /api/users/login with credentials. The server verifies the details and returns a JWT.

Subsequent Requests:
The client includes the JWT in the headers of future requests:
Authorization: Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>
This allows the server to authenticate users without retaining session data.

4. Use Case: E-commerce API Flow
Product Listing:
The client sends a GET request to /api/products, and the server responds with a list of products in JSON format.

Order Placement:
After user authentication (via JWT), the client sends a POST request to /api/orders with order details. The server processes and confirms the order.
